## Idea

Intrigued by the rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence, I couldn't resist the urge to dive into the ChatGPT API. To channel my focus, I embarked on an exciting experiment: building a recipe generator. 

Committed to continuously expanding my knowledge in emerging technologies, I've embraced a proactive approach: learning by doing.
This endeavour led me down the path of ASP.NET to master C#, coupled with an Angular frontend.
